Welcome to Thorium! Thorium is currently in Alpha status, so there is still a lot to be done. 

* File an [issue](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). Issues are for bug reports, feature requests, and anything in between. If there is something you want done, file an issue!
* If you don't understand what an issue means, write a comment with your question and someone will explain in more detail.
* Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2) to know what features are coming and when they are coming.
* Read up on how Thorium works in the [wiki](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/wiki)
* Write some code and file a [pull request](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/pulls).

All pull requests and issues are welcome. Pull requests must match an issue. When creating the pull request, either include `refs #issue-num` or `closes #issue-num`.
