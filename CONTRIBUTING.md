Welcome to Thorium! Thorium is currently in Beta status, so there is still a lot to be done. 

* File an [issue](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). Issues are for bug reports, feature requests, and anything in between. If there is something you want done, file an issue!
* If you don't understand what an issue means, write a comment with your question and someone will explain in more detail.
* Check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2) to know what features are coming and when they are coming.
* Read up on how Thorium works in the [wiki](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/wiki) and the [docs](https://thoriumsim.com)
* Write some code and file a [pull request](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/pulls). A handful of issues are labeled [Help Wanted](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and are a good place to start.

All pull requests and issues are welcome, with the following requirements:

* Pull requests must match an issue. When creating the pull request, either include `refs #issue-num` or `closes #issue-num`. No exceptions. 
* Any new pull requests will not be accepted unless a corresponding issue or pull request from [thorium-docs](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium-docs) is referenced, within reason. Some things don't need to be documented, but if there is any reason for docs to be created or updated, this will be a hard requirement.
